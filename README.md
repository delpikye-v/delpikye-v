# 👋 Hi, I’m Delpi Kye  

I’m a **Software Engineer** passionate about building **scalable web applications, frontend architectures, and developer tooling**.  
With experience in **React, Vue.js, Golang, Python, and cloud-native systems**, I enjoy creating tools and libraries that improve developer experience.

## 🧠 Architecture – Frontend

This ecosystem keeps **business logic outside React**, fully orchestrated and predictable.

> UI renders. Logic orchestrates. Runtime guarantees determinism.

```text
Frontend/UI
   │
   ▼
logic-runtime-react-z
   │
   ▼
chrono-state-z
   │
   ▼
intentx-core-z
```

- **logic-runtime-react-z** – React bindings layer  
- **chrono-state-z** – Intent-first state runtime (atoms, computed, async, effects)  
- **intentx-core-z** – Deterministic reactive scheduler

### 🔄 Intent Flow

```text
UI / HTTP / Queue / Cron
        │
        ▼
     emit(intent)
        │
        ▼
   effects / middleware
        │
        ▼
   intent handlers
        │
        ▼
     mutate state
        │
        ▼
computed (derived state) / subscribers
```

> events → behavior → state → derived state
